 Hi👋, I’m Umut. I'm studying electrical and electronics engineering at Akdeniz University. I'm interested in Web Development few years.
I am improving myself on back-end development with Spring Framework, ASP.Net and Nestjs.
I'm working with Angular and React on the front-end side.
Every day I learn new things about web development and I continue to improve myself in this field.
